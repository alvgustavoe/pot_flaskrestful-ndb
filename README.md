# pot_flaskrestful-ndb
Build a POT (Proof of Technology) for Flask-RESTful integration with NDB. The main objective is to validate Flask-RESTful integrated with NDB and meet the requirements of this particular application. Even this POT is an asset of the project, it will have it's own repository. The idea behind this is to keep it free from business logic. This way will be easier teach to new developers how we use this technology.
